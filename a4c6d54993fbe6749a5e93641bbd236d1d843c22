      "message": "All the ROADM types also tag these metrics with `\u0027channel\u0027: \u0027\u0027`, so I think it would be nice to follow that pattern here as well. I think that it was meant to suggest \"this is a power monitor which applies to an entire spectrum with no filters whatsoever\".\n\nOne could argue that it should have said something like `\u0027channel\u0027: \u0027c-band\u0027`, but that\u0027s not what the ROADMs are reporting. We could change that later, but for now please sync the inline-amp reporting with the ROADMs.",
